Hi!,
I am Gabriel,
And this is the repo for my Resistor Calculator Project. You can follow the next instructions to run the Backend and the Frontend.

// First off, Clone this repo
// After you successfully cloned the repo.

// Open 2 terminals
* Both projects run in Node 16.16.0v or further, so make sure that you have the proper version.

In the first terminal go to the Backend Project folder: cd Backend
* Make sure that the .env file is populated with the necessary env variables to be able to run the Project.
* For this ocassion I decided to setup an Atlas Mongo Cluster so you don't have to run the database locally.
// Run npm install and wait for the deps to be ready.
// After the dependencies were installed, run the Project: npm run dev

In the second terminal go to the Frontend Project folder: cd Frontend
* Make sure that the .env file is populated with the necessary env variables to be able to run the Project.
* For a matter of time, I was unable to setup the Tests for the Project. In advance, thank you for your understanding.
// Run npm install and wait.
// After the dependencies were installed, run the Project: npm run dev
